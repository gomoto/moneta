## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## App settings

The @angular/cli "environment" system does not support deploy-time configuration from environment variables.

In addition to building the application, you can build a file called `settings.js` that defines a global object called `AppSettings` with which the application will override its default settings. The script which builds that file, `scripts/settings.sh`, accepts configuration from environment variables.
